/** Protects the restaurant app. Owner-facing Supabase-Auth routes are protected separately
 *  by RLS + server-side checks in their own layouts; this middleware specifically guards the
 *  PIN-authenticated staff app, since that traffic carries our own cookie, not a Supabase one.
 *
 *  Every page under app/(restaurant)/ — dashboard, inventory, employees, accounts, permissions,
 *  etc. — plus /pos needs this check. Rather than listing each one in `matcher` (which silently
 *  stops protecting a page the moment it's renamed or moved, as happened when the dashboard/*
 *  routes were flattened to top-level paths), the matcher below runs on effectively everything
 *  except static assets and /api, and the small PUBLIC_PATHS allowlist below carves out the
 *  pages that must stay reachable without a session: the landing page, signup, and both staff
 *  login screens. Any new page added under (restaurant)/ is protected automatically. */
